# Customer Churn Risk Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project simulates a key task for a Data Science Intern at Dynatrace: **modeling customer churn risk and visualizing insights through an interactive dashboard.**  

Using a real-world **Customer Churn Dataset**, I built a **Logistic Regression model** to predict churn probability, categorized customers into risk levels (Low, Medium, High), and designed a **Dash-based web dashboard** to display key insights.
